# Pathfinding-Javascript

This is a visualization tool for the A* pathfinding algorithm. The tool allows users to create a grid of obstacles and select starting and ending points for the algorithm to find the shortest path between. The tool also allows for the visualization of the Manhattan Distance Heuristic algorithm.

## Usage

- To create obstacles, simply click on the squares of the grid.
- To set the starting point, press the "i" key and then click on the square you want to use as the starting point.
- To set the ending point, press the "f" key and then click on the square you want to use as the ending point.
- Press the "e" key to run the A* algorithm and visualize the shortest path.
- Press the "m" key to run the Manhattan Distance Heuristic algorithm and visualize the shortest path.
- Press the "r" key to randomly generate obstacles on the grid.
- Press the "1" or "2" key to load preset maps.
## Note

This visualization tool is for educational and demonstration purposes only, it is not recommended for use in production environments.
